Conveyor is a comprehensive UI library for quickly building UI components to interact with GraphQL APIs generated by the [Magql](https://github.com/autoinvent/magql) library. It provides an intuitive and user-friendly interface for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on your GraphQL data.

```bash
pnpm install @autoinvent/conveyor
```

Then you can use it in your project.
